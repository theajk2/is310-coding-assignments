The website I chose was the Flash Point archive. I can immediately tell that this website was made using html, because I can see the doctype and head/body labels. 

I can tell that a lot of people collaborated on this project because of the multitude of github links and collaborators. I can go to the repository and look at the various commits. The archive was started by Ben "BlueMaxima" Latimore.
